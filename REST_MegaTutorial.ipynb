    "The application will exist in a package. In Python, a sub-directory that includes a __init.py__ files is considered a package, and can be imported. When you import a package, the __init__.py executes and defines what symbols the package exposes to the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __init__.py created in the folder `app` has the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "app = Flask (__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "from app import routes\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The script above simply creates the application object as an instance of class `Flask` class is a Python predefined variable, which is set to the name of the module in which it is used. Flask uses the location of the module passed here as a starting point when it needs to load associated resources such as template files. For all practical purposes, passing `__name__` is almost always going to configure Flask in the correct way. The application then imports `routes`, which doesn't exist yet. \n",
    "\n",
    "`routes` are imported at the bottom, and not at the top. The bottom import is a workaround to circular imports, a common problem with Flask applications. `routes` module will need to import the `app` variable defined in this script, so putting one of the reciprocal imports at the bottom avoids the error that results from the mutual references between these two files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The routes are the different URLs that the application implements. In Flask, handlers for the application routes are written as Python functions, called view functions; it takes a web request and returns a web response. \n",

    "Content of `routes.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from app import app\n",

    "@app.route('/index')\n",
    "def index():\n",
    "    return \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Two `@app.route` above the function are decorators, a unique feature in Python. A decorator modifies the function that follows it. A common pattern with decorators is to use them to register functions as callbacks for certain events. In this case, the `@app.route` decorator creates an association between the URL given as an argument and the function. Here, there are two decorators, and when a web browser requests either of these two URLs, Flask is going to invoke this function and pass the return value of it back to the browser as a response.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both `routes.py` and `__init.py__` are saved in the folder named `app`. The third function, `microblog.py` is defined in the main folder. The content:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from app import app\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we run it, Flask needs to be told how to import it, by setting the `FLASK_APP=microblog.py`. `FLASK_APP` is used to specify how to load application. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note! It seems like there are two ways to run it: one with `FLASK_app`; the other one is to define `if __name__ = main`\n",
    "\n",
    "Since environment variabels aren't remembered across terminal sessions, it's annoying to always set the `FLASK_APP` when you open a new terminal window. We can register environmental variables that we want to import when we run the `flask` command. For that, `python-dotenv` is used"
